My two years of college classes were going to have to carry us through the entire experience. I did decently, except I failed to account for the grainy overhead system of the train blurring an already blurry-language. <br> <br> When the train conductor called out what I thought was our stop, I proposed getting off the train. Luke, looking at his phone, insisted that the math didn\'t work out, and that we couldn\'t be there already. I hadn\'t heard the conductor clearly, so I agreed, glad for his confidence.<br> <br> It wasn\'t until we got to the next stop, and I heard “Lille” that I suspected we had messed up. Lille was too far east. It was even worse when a woman came up and insisted that we had taken her seat. We hadn\'t stolen any seat... we just hadn\'t abandoned ours early enough. So we get out, and with some difficulty, manage to buy new tickets going back the other way. I get a bit confused when the ticket desk manager tries to explain that Calais, the city we\'re visiting, has two train stations, but he also explains that they only serve one. So we go for our original destination, Calais-Frethun.<br> <br>Going back now, I can see that the Calais-Frethun train station is almost 12 kilometers away from our hotel. At the time however, I put my trust in Luke, who insisted it was just a short stretch north.<br> <br> We walked. There was no sign of any port-town as far as I could tell. Further, and I saw a tractor. Further, and I started to worry. My feet began to hurt. I didn\'t see a soul on the street. No one had left the train station and walked this direction.<br> <br> Finally, we find a little shop where I enter and ask for directions to Calais. 6 kilometers north, she says. We walk for another 20 minutes and I ask yet another shopkeeper to guide us. 6 kilometers north, he says. <br><br>My feet are going to fall off my legs and shrivel up at this point, I\'m sure of it. But we keep walking. I try to keep spirits up. Stuff goes wrong when you travel, it\'s just a fact of life.<br><br>The sidewalk ends. The sun is going down. The road is gravelly, the speed limit is high, and I\'m starting to worry that we might get hit by a car. My worry and exhaustion must be apparent from a distance even, because we manage to look pathetic enough that a man pulls over, opens his passenger door, and shouts “Calais?”. I nod, say “oui” and pull Luke into the car. <br><br>The man drives waaaay faster than the already fast speed limit, plays absurdly loud french techno-pop, and speaks not a single word of English. But when we get close, he turns and asks “Théâtre?” I confirm: “Théâtre.” I have absolutely no clue where the theatre might be but I have to assume it\'s somewhere near the middle of town, and I\'m just glad to have been saved the 5 extra kilometers of walking. The man stops in the middle of traffic, nods towards the door and says “Théâtre.” one final time and we collapse-fall out of his car onto the sidewalk with a chorus of “Merci”s. Still 1 to 2 kilometers to go, but we make it and watch the sun set on the beach.<br><br>Always have a plan. Always have a plan. Always have a plan. <br>And don\'t let that plan be “just wander north until you find it.”<br><br>My faith in Luke\'s ability to plan is totally shaken, but my faith in the kindness of humanity is feeling strong after the generosity shown to us in our first days in France.')

Food should not be that good so consistently. <br> <br> The planning... well, this is where the drop comes in. I trusted Luke with all the planning for this part of the trip and that was a mistake on my part. His plan was to not plan. He didn\'t set an alarm, thinking “we would want to sleep in”. We waited at the train station for an hour and a half for luggage storage because he didn\'t have a plan for the luggage. We bought all the tickets on my credit card because none of his functioned overseas. We ate buckwheat crepes at the outside of the Pompidou because of Jeff\'s recommendation (which was amazing) and then didn\'t go in the museum because we wanted to hit the Louvre first and loop back. <br> <br> Except that when we got to the Louvre, I looked in the bag and saw no train tickets. Our $300 a pop, non refundable, non exchangeable, completely crucial train tickets were missing. <br> <br> And when I told Luke this, he looked me in the eye, said “I don\'t know where they are.” and ran off in a dead sprint. <br> <br> Leaving me, alone, in line at the Louvre, with no idea where he might have run off to. <br> <br> I find him frantically running about the courtyard, eyes glued to the ground. Then, he starts trying to ask random umbrella salesmen if they\'ve seen any train tickets... in English. They\'re clearly confused and I have to peel him away from them before he wastes any more time or emotional energy. Then, he insists on running back to the restaurant without me. <br> <br> We go back to the train station. As suspected, they aren\'t willing to reprint the tickets, exchange them, or do anything other than offer to sell us new ones. <br> <br> Except all the late trains are totally sold out, and the only room left is standing room on a train leaving in a half hour. <br> <br> So we leave Paris, having not seen any of the things I wanted to see except from the outside, many dollars poorer, and cramped up into a tiny space on the train next to a yippy dog. <br> <br> But, we also leave with a promise to come back. If nothing else, I have won this. <br> <br> So this panicked trip to Paris leaves me with a promise and a few hard earned lessons. Always have a plan, always have a plan, always have a plan.

Our work styles and communication styles were still starkly different, but we had finally built enough of a shared v\'ion to start breaking into roles and working in more familiar ways. <br> <br> I feel like that first T&T project was a crash course in working in diverse teams in a way that I could not have possibly predicted.

The brief itself emphasized the early stages of the creative process, and everyone we spoke with in the early and middle stages of our own process encouraged us to really take our time and develop our research thoroughly. We started to believe, and were literally told, that having mockups would be completely unnecessary. <br> <br> So we were quite shocked when we presented and seemed to receive a lot of questions on why we did not have mockups. It blindsided us a little bit and made us feel that we had not been given clear expectations. But the more I\'ve thought about it, the more I\'ve realized that we could have predicted that result. My team had a similar issue the first time through – everyone repeatedly warned us against sketching anything remotely concrete, but as soon as we did, we got markedly more useful feedback and guidance. <br> <br> I think this was a similar situation that neither team truly recognized. We also forgot that different people would have very different expectations, especially if the internal communication between T&T employees was not clear. Most of the people we had interacted with early on in the project weren\'t able to see our presentation; consequently, most of the people at our presentation had interacted with the assignment very little. <br> <br> Overall, while it was frustrating at the time to be so surprised by their feedback, they did have valuable guidance.

It was a bit confusing at first, especially due to the escalators and elevators and stairs that all seemed to service different floors. But once I found my bearings, I was enthralled. The Tate seemed to use space in a way that I had not noticed at the other museums. The Turbine Hall in particular was marked by an abundance of empty space. It was actually really interesting. I stared at an empty room for a few minutes, filling the space with various imaginings, before I realized how bizarre the whole thing was. <br> <br> I then went up to the second floor for an exhibit on surrealism. Surrealism is one genre of art that I find fairly interesting, and the Tate did not disappoint. I found that the pieces were very polarized for me though – some were distinctly uninteresting to me, and others I stared at for what felt like ages. In between the more interesting pieces, I also got in a good amount of people watching. I was surprised by the number of small children in the space, and pleasantly surprised by the amount of people sketching, writing, and photographing the space. <br> <br> One room in particular inspired a strong emotional response from me. The experience was meant to feel somewhat like a nightmare, according to the plaque, and while I can see that, it wasn\'t much like my actual nightmares. It was deeply unsettling though. The room was a darkened dead end, with various unintelligible voices and noises coming through. There was the occasional crack of light that would briefly etch the other people in the room brightly into your burned eyes, and otherwise nothing but shadow. But the creepiest thing of all was actually the children. Children were moving around, laughing and bumping into people in the room, or creepily sitting in the corners, staring wordlessly. They were honestly sort of terrifying. Most people stood at the edge of the room looking in, which I spent a while doing, but the experience was definitely more overwhelming in the middle. I was uncomfortable the entire time... but also very entertained. <br> <br> Kids made my experience a little creepier in the upstairs exhibit as well. I was looking at a weird sort of off-kilter piece when some little boys started whistling, echoing around the corners of the space. <br> <br> Still, all in all I was thoroughly engaged the entire time and I thought a lot about how the space and the people IN the space contributed to my engagement with works that may not have been nearly as enchanting in different contexts.

Not knowing what to do, I copied, and she asked if I had come for the press event. After I awkwardly explained my ignorance, I heard her talking with a coworker, saying she thought I was the writer from Buzzfeed. After I told my friends they told me that I should have played along, but at the time I was too flustered to even think of that. <br> <br> Reflecting later, I had to wonder what it would be like to work in one of those spaces. Customers can walk into your creative space at any moment. Do they look over your shoulder? Ask questions? Does it add energy or just distract? Do you ever get used to it?<br> <br> I was so tempted to camp out there and observe for a while, but I think the experience poses interesting questions in reference to our studies of organizational creativity and spaces.')

      .addStory('Rainbows at Sunset', 'For some reason, the London Eye just did not sound interesting to me. I\'ve never been very into ferris wheels, and I don\'t really have that sense of obligation some people seem to feel towards tourist attractions. I didn\'t feel like I was missing out when the participatory memory students went on a day that I missed. <br> <br> But when a group of the other students asked if I wanted to join them something in me clicked and I decided to go. And now in retrospect I\'m so glad I went out of my expectations for this. The London Eye was actually pretty amazing. It was gently raining, but the orange sunset was still filtering through the clouds and I got to see the London skyline with both sunset and rainbows going at the same time. It was almost surreal. This was one occasion where I am glad I did not go with my own instinct.')

      .addStory('Zoned Out', 'So one of the things that I have had to work on in both the past year and this trip in particular is self care. It\'s easy for me to get absorbed into all the things I have to do and forget to do the simple, obvious things like relax, sleep, and eat proper meals at the proper times. I\'ve been better about it in my normal day to day but this shakeup of my routine threw me off and my self care fell to the wayside. <br> <br> In particular, I failed to account for the fact that I would need time alone to process. So it was a lucky break when I took the Metropolitan line the wrong way and got some glorious uninterrupted alone time, all the way out into Zone 6. Even after I realized my mistake, there wasn\'t much point in worrying over it, since the stations get so far apart this far out that you have no choice but to wait. I simply wrote in my pocket journal, stared out the window, and basked in my accidental gift to myself. It was a real wake up call and after that I made a much bigger point of taking time out intentionally to just hang out alone, which eased a lot of tension in other areas of my experience. It was definitely a change in course for managing my time and priorities, as well as balancing work and life.')

      .addStory('Chaos Theory', 'Going into this trip, I was not sure what to expect. When I sat down with the goal setting assignment, I felt distinctly lost. I didn\'t feel that I had anything concrete to work with. So my mindset was centered on the idea of being open and adaptive. In some ways it felt like a trust fall; I had to just believe that there would be experiences where I had the opportunity to adapt and grow without thorough planning. Luckily I believe that the trip lived up to and exceeded all my vague expectations, but the trust fall experience in itself was a chance to grow for me. I am sometimes perceived as a bit chaotic myself due to my level of comfort in improvisation, but I am actually an obsessive planner in some ways. Scheduling my classes every year is a delicate and complicated balancing act based on numerous variables and multiple pages of notes.I check my bank account every week and even keep a loose budget. I actually read restaurant reviews before I choose places. I am, despite appearances, a planner. I just don\'t mind much when my plans change. <br> <br> For me, taking on such a huge experience without the obligation to find a hotel or plan my own days out was both refreshing and a bit scary. It was an opportunity to walk the walk a bit on my own claimed flexibility and I actually enjoyed it throughly. I also learned the boundaries of this approach with a bit of a failed trust fall on the Paris weekend... but there\'s more about that in the actual Paris write up over at St. Pancras.')

      .addStory('Leaving London', 'For some reason that I can\'t quite understand, I could not sleep the night before my flight home. I managed to get my eyes shut for a little under 3 hours. Staring at London as I walked to Russell Square didn\'t feel like a goodbye. It felt like I was just dragging my luggage around for no particular reason. In that way, it closely mirrored my feelings leaving America for this trip. I just didn\'t feel like leaving was real. <br> <br> Looking back now, some of the memories are already starting to blur at the edges. That saddens me, but also reminds me to keep pushing, and keep traveling. I learned a lot about the way my creative and professional processes work (and don\'t work) with others, and I can\'t wait to apply that knowledge. I\'ve learned a lot about myself, and I actually feel much more comfortable now reaching out for help or advice from those who could mentor me. This alone feels invaluable. I\'ve learned more than can accurately or even remotely succinctly be put into words. <br> <br> I know for a fact that this trip has pushed me to grow as both a person and professional – which is exactly what I had been hoping for. I\'m glad that I took chances, even if they didn\'t always work out, and I\'m glad that I gave people chances. I\'m walking away from this trip richer in friendship, knowledge, experience, wisdom, stories, and way, way, way poorer in money. I can\'t think of a better trade. I am both insanely lucky and equally grateful.')
